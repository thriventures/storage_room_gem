== StorageRoom Gem

This gem provides read and write access to the StorageRoom API (http://storageroomapp.com). 

== Main Features

* ActiveRecord/ActiveModel like interface.
* Automatic creation of Entry Classes from a Collection, you don't have to configure anything
* Supports lazy-loading of associations (e.g. post.category will fetch a category transparently if it has not yet been loaded)
* Supports caching through an identity map, so that Resources don't have to be loaded multiple times


== Installation

To install the library execute:

  sudo gem install storage_room


== Basic Usage

This is a walkthrough with all steps you need to setup a devise entry, including model, migration, route files, and optional configuration.
  
  StorageRoom.authenticate(YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, YOUR_APPLICATION_API_KEY)
  collection = StorageRoom::Collection.find('4ddaf68b4d085d374a000003')
  
  entry = collection.entries.resources.first # collection.entries contains meta information, the resources key contains the returned objects
  
  entry.name = 'Foobar'
  
  if entry.save
    puts "Entry saved."
  else
    puts "Could not save Entry: #{entry.errors.join(', )}"
  end
